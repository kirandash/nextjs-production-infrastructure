# Next.js Workshop - Setting Up Production-Ready Infrastructure for Scalable Apps

## 1 Eslint and prettier

- Eslint: Linting tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. And check for errors etc.
- Prettier: Code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- Both these tools will help you to maintain a consistent code style and avoid errors.
- Create a new next project
  - `pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest my-first-next-app --use-pnpm`
  - install with all defaults
  - check eslintrc.json and you should see: `"extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"]`
  - to run lint: `pnpm run lint`
