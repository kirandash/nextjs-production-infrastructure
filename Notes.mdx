# Next.js Workshop - Setting Up Production-Ready Infrastructure for Scalable Apps

## 1 Eslint and prettier

- Eslint: Linting tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. And check for errors etc.
- Prettier: Code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- Both these tools will help you to maintain a consistent code style and avoid errors.
- Create a new next project
  - `pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest my-first-next-app --use-pnpm`
  - install with all defaults
  - check eslintrc.json and you should see: `"extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"]`
  - to run lint: `pnpm run lint`
  - install prettier and make sure prettier and eslint are in sync
    - https://prettier.io/
    - important: how to make sure prettier and eslint rules does not conflict with each other
    - https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier
    - `pnpm add --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`
    - Prettier plugins:
      - Prettier Tailwind plugin
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
      - Import sort plugins:
        - https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports
        - https://github.com/IanVS/prettier-plugin-sort-imports (âœ… Recommended)
          - `pnpm add --save-dev @ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`

## 2 Project organization

### 2.1 Component File Patterns

- 1. One component per file (Some Developers do this but not recommended)

  - it works well with small components ex: Button, Input etc but not with complex components. With complex component it's possible that the line number will go in 100s ex: 500 lines of code. And then it might make the chunk size bigger.
  - Note that if prop changes, the whole component will re-render. So it's better to split the component into smaller components. So that only the smaller component will re-render.

- 2. Nested Components ðŸš¨ - Anti-Pattern

  - DO NOT USE THIS PATTERN!
  - Drawbacks:
    - If you have a component that has more than 3 levels of nesting, then it's better to move that component to a separate file.
    - Component Definition Inside Component: Each component is defined inside another component, which means they get redefined on every render.
    - State Management Issues: Each nested component has its own state, but they're recreated on every render of their parent, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
    - Poor Reusability: These components can't be used anywhere else in the application since they're scoped inside their parent component.
    - Debugging Difficulty: The component hierarchy becomes harder to understand and debug due to the nested structure.
    - Performance Issues: React hooks (like useState) should not be used in nested component definitions as they can lead to bugs and memory leaks.
    - Next.js will not be able to optimize the nested components as well as the top level components.

- 3. âœ… Recommended: One exported component per file
  - Benefits:
    - One Component Per File: Each component is defined in its own file, making it easier to maintain and test.
    - Clear Dependencies: The import/export structure clearly shows how components depend on each other.
    - Reusability: Components can be easily reused in other parts of the application.
    - Maintainability: Each file has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and modify.
    - Better Testing: Components can be tested in isolation more easily.
    - Proper Tree-Shaking: Unused components can be eliminated during the build process.
  - Rules:
  - Don't put too many lines of code in one file
  - Max 200 lines of code per file

### 2.2 Component Folder Structure and how to import them

- Each component may have multiple related files ex:
  - the component itself
  - test file
  - storybook file
  - documentation
  - style file
- How to organize the assets?
  - All files related to a component should be in the same folder.
    - One component per folder
  - Please use relative paths for importing all the assets within the component folder.
- Benefits:
  - Easier to navigate
  - Easier to understand
  - Easier to test
  - Easier to maintain
  - Easier to move the component to another folder

### 2.3 Component Location

- 1. Page specific components
- If a component is only used by one route, then it should be placed in the route folder.
- 2. Shared components
  - If a component is used in multiple routes, then it should be placed in the common components folder.
  - src/app/components
    - shadcn: for all shadcn components
    - bgwebagency-design-system: for all bgwebagency components
- 3. Shared Components across projects:
  - MonoRepo (Turborepo): (âœ… Recommended)
    - components that are used in multiple projects should be moved from app level to packages level
    - apps folder: for all the apps
    - packages folder: for all the packages
      - packages/typescript-config
      - packages/eslint-config
      - packages/ui
        - packages/ui/button
        - packages/ui/card
        - packages/ui/input
        - packages/ui/accordion
        - packages/ui/dialog and so on...
  - npm package:
    - Shared Components can be a single npm package and can be used in multiple projects
    - during local development, we can use the local package by linking it using pnpm
    - This is also ok but I don't use it

### 2.4 Component Naming Conventions

- Not very strict but use either PascalCase or kebab-case
- I use the following naming convention:
  - Standard: `Button.tsx`, `AlertDialog.tsx`, `Checkbox.tsx` etc
    - it uses PascalCase
  - Shadcn: `ui/button.tsx`, `ui/alert-dialog.tsx`, `ui/checkbox.tsx` etc
    - it uses kebab-case
  - bgwebagency: `Button.tsx`, `AlertDialog.tsx`, `Checkbox.tsx` etc
    - it uses PascalCase

## 3. Storybook

- https://storybook.js.org/
- Storybook is a tool for
  - developing UI components and pages in isolation
  - documentation
  - testing
- It also helps collaboration between developers and designers and managers etc.
- It's a good way of demonstrating the component in the best possible way.
- stories.ts:
  - `autodocs`: automatically generate documentation for the component
- use `build-storybook` to build the storybook and you can host it on vercel or any other static site hosting service like s3 etc.
